# dbtCore
**dbt Core** enables data analysts and data engineers to transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse. These select statements or "models" form a dbt project. Dbt core makes it easy to manage relationships between models, visualise these relationships and assure the quality of your transformations through testing.
It develops the project from the command line and run dbt projects.

There is only one project [dbtCoreProject](https://github.com/Longwinter93/dbtCoreProject/tree/main/dbtCoreProjectTraining).
